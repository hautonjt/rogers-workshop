### VM Specifications

| **CPU** | **Memory** | **Storage** | **OS**           |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 8 vCPUs | 16GB RAM   | 50GB        | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS |

### SSH Access to the VM

Each participant will access their virtual machine (VM) via SSH. Please follow the instructions below to connect:

1. **Retrieve VM IP and Credentials**  
   - Your VMâ€™s IP address and login credentials will be provided at the start of the workshop. Ensure you have these details ready.

2. **Connecting via SSH**  
   - **Linux/macOS Users**:  
     Open a terminal and use the following command:
     ```bash
     ssh username@your_vm_ip
     ```

3. **SSH Key Setup (Optional)**  
   - For a more secure and convenient connection, you can set up SSH keys. Run the following commands to generate a key pair and add it to your VM:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
     ssh-copy-id username@your_vm_ip
     ```
   - Once configured, you can log in without a password.



### Local Setup (Optional)

For participants who want to replicate the environment on their own device:

| **Requirement** | **Specification**                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| CPU             | 8 vCPUs                          |
| Memory          | 16GB RAM                         |
| Storage         | 50GB free                        |
| OS              | Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 (preferred) |


## Workshop Agenda

### Day 1: 19th November

   Set up and deploy a 5G core network on Kubernetes, configure network slices, and simulate user equipment for traffic testing.

2. **[Monitoring Network Slices](slice-monitoring.md)**  
   Configure monitoring tools for network slice telemetry, set up dashboards, and analyze slice performance metrics in real-time.

### Day 2: 20th November

1. **Introduction to Data Processing Pipelines**  
   Overview of data pipeline technologies, focusing on handling large-scale 5G telemetry data.

2. **Hands-on with Kibana and Spark**  
   Explore data visualization with Kibana and data processing with Spark to analyze and manage slice data.

3. **Dynamic Resource Scaling**  
   Implement dynamic scaling for slice resources based on network demand and load.

4. **Building and Training a Slice Model**  
   Gather a 5G dataset and use machine learning to train a model for predictive slice management.
